					<p> Maybe, an artist. Instead of an easel - a tripod. Instead of brushes - a camera that transmits feelings and emotions in one shot. And one day opening the album, reviewing pictures in the minds memories begin to emerge, the same emotions that had been on the day of the shooting. And by the will of a smile appears on the face, and maybe even tears, tears of joy. This site is a small part of my work, I want to show you. Enjoy watching!
